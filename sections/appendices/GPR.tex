\section{Appendix A: Gaussian process regression}\label{app:GPR}
Here we provide the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:GP-posterior}.
\GPpost*
\begin{proof}
    Let $p,p' \in \Theta$ be two prediction points, and let $Y_{\hat{P} } = (Y_{p_1}, \ldots, Y_{p_n}, Y_p, Y_{p'})$. 
    We will derive the joint posterior distribution for $Y_{\hat{P}}$ by Bayes theorem and then obtain the mean predictiom for $Y_p$ and the covariance between $Y_p$ and $Y_{p'}$ by exploiting some linear algebra results. \\
    By \textit{(GPR-model)}, the
