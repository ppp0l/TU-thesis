# Regression Techniques for Surrogate Modelling in Bayesian Inverse Problems 
## Master's Thesis - Paolo Villani - TU Berlin
This thesis considers the use of two Machine Learning regression techniques - Gaussian Process Regression and Lipschitz Regression - for surrogate modelling in the context of Bayesian Inverse Problems with computationally expensive forward models given by Finite Element discretizations of a Partial Differential equation.
